# Snake-Reinforcement-Learning
This is a demonstration of using Q-Learning for the game _Snake_.

## Usage
This is to be run in a Python interactive session in the command line, where ANSI escape codes are supported. Otherwise, such as in IDLE, printouts will not show properly.
```
import snake
ai = snake.AI()
ai.run()
```

## Libraries
The `numpy` library is required.
